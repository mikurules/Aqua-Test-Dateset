# Aqua-Test-Dateset
We selects underwater images from the CAMO-TE, CHAMELEON-TE and COD10K-TE data sets and forms a new underwater camouflage object data set with a total of 455 images, called the Aqua-Test data set, to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of DDANet in identifying underwater camouflage objects.
